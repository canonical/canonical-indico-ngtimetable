NG Timetable for Indico
=======================

A fresh take on the timetable in Indico. It is simple yet powerful. Works nicely on mobile which
most folks will use during the in-person event. Though beware, it is also somewhat opinionated:

* Contributions should start at :00 or :30 of any given hour. They will be shown as multiples of :30 minutes to maximize space.
* Contributions less than 20 minutes will not show, unless they are in a session block (e.g. Lightning Talks)
* Each contribution needs a room assigned, your conference revolves around having sessions in a limited set of rooms.
* Your conference goes at most 7 days. More is ok, but weekday names are used to identify days.
* Make sure you set a room on all contributions and session blocks.
